Differences between Python 2 and Python 3

1. Certain libraries are made specifically for python2 and not for python3 so the version really matters there.

2. The way integer division is handled is entirely different. In python2 if you were to, for example, do 5 / 2 it would round down to 2 because it wanted to give an int as an output. In python3, it will automatically convert the result to a float and correctly answer 2.5.

3. Strings are encoded in unicode instead of ASCII by default in python3.

4. As a minor change, print requires the argument in parenthesis in python3 but not in python2.
